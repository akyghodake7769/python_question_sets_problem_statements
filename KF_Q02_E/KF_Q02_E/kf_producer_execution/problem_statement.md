# Kafka Lab : Kafka Producer Execution

Duration : 60 Min.

## Scenario

Publish structural events feed into a Kafka topic.

## Input Details

The environment has been pre-configured with the following resources:
- **Kafka Broker:** Pre-configured on localhost:9092

## Username & Naming Conventions

Your candidate prefix is a combination of your username (the part of your email/login before the `@` or `_` symbol) and exam code.
For example, if your username is `student` (or `student_labskraft.com`) and your exam code is `exam123`, your prefix is **`student-exam123`**.

You must name your resources accordingly:

- **Topic Name:** `events-stream-<prefix>` (e.g. `events-stream-student-exam123`)

## Task Objectives

### 1. Build Producer Script
- Publish formatted JSON alerts payload to the topic.

## Verification

Once you have performed the tasks, you can run the verification script to check your progress and receive your score. The verification system will check the actual resources in the environment.

## Grading Criteria

Your performance will be evaluated based on the following test cases:

| Test Case | Requirement | Marks |
| --------- | ----------- | ----- |
| **TC1** | JSON structure verification | 4 Marks |
| **TC2** | Message ingestion count check | 4 Marks |
| **TC3** | Broker connectivity check | 4 Marks |
| **TC4** | Reserved validation | 4 Marks |
| **TC5** | Reserved validation | 4 Marks |

**Total Score: 20 Marks**

## Important Notes

- Ensure all resource names contain your candidate username prefix in lowercase.
- Check that your script compiles cleanly and contains no syntax errors.
