# Databricks Lab : Delta Table Operations

Duration : 60 Min.

## Scenario

You need to demonstrate primary DML operations on Delta tables, including updating records and verifying table history details.

## Input Details

The environment has been pre-configured with the following resources:
- **Workspace:** Pre-configured through KodeBuck Service credentials (`DATABRICKS_HOST`, `DATABRICKS_TOKEN`)

## Username & Naming Conventions

Your candidate prefix is a combination of your username (the part of your email/login before the `@` or `_` symbol) and exam code.
For example, if your username is `student` (or `student_labskraft.com`) and your exam code is `exam123`, your prefix is **`student-exam123`**.

You must name your resources accordingly:

- **Delta Table Name:** `<prefix>_delta_update` (e.g. `student_exam123_delta_update`)

## Task Objectives

### 1. Create and Update Delta Table
- Create a Delta table named `<prefix>_delta_update`.
- Run updates on the table and verify history version logging.

## Verification

Once you have performed the tasks, you can run the verification script to check your progress and receive your score. The verification system will check the actual resources in the environment.

## Grading Criteria

Your performance will be evaluated based on the following test cases:

| Test Case | Requirement | Marks |
| --------- | ----------- | ----- |
| **TC1** | Delta table existence (`<prefix>_delta_update` exists) | 4 Marks |
| **TC2** | Row update validation | 4 Marks |
| **TC3** | History version check | 4 Marks |
| **TC4** | Reserved validation | 4 Marks |
| **TC5** | Reserved validation | 4 Marks |

**Total Score: 20 Marks**

## Important Notes

- Ensure all resource names contain your candidate username prefix in lowercase.
- Check that your script compiles cleanly and contains no syntax errors.
