Duration : 45 Min.

## Scenario
A message processing worker crashes repeatedly on corrupt payloads, stalling the main transaction queue.

## Task Objectives
Perform the following actions inside the `student_workspace` directory:
- Configure consumer retry boundaries, backoff intervals, and redirect failures to a Dead Letter Queue.

## Instructions to Perform the Task
1. When your workspace loads in **VS Code**, use the **Explorer** panel on the left to locate your files.
2. Navigate to and click the specific files mentioned in the Task Objectives.
3. Make the necessary code edits in the editor.

5. If you need to run commands, open the built-in terminal by clicking **Terminal > New Terminal** from the top menu.

## Validation
Once you have saved your files and are ready to submit, return to the platform dashboard and click the **"Submit Final"** button. This task is evaluated manually by the grading team.

## Evaluation Rubric:
1. Setting maximum retry limits before routing messages to DLQ: 3 marks
2. Configuring exponential backoff retry intervals: 3 marks
3. Configuring DLQ queues and alert monitoring for processing errors: 4 marks

**Total Score: 10 Marks**
