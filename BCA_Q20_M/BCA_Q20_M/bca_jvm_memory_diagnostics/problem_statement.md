# Basic Code Analysis: JVM Memory OutOfMemoryError Diagnostics

Duration : 90 Min.

## Scenario
Your server crashed with a java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space. Analyze the JVM heap memory dump logs and thread logs to find the memory leak.

## Target File Location & Creation
**File to Create/Update**: `student_workspace/solution.json`
**Input Resource File to Inspect**: `student_workspace/jvm_heap_dump.txt`

## Task Objectives
Perform the following actions inside the `student_workspace` directory:
- Document the leak suspect object class name and line number inside 'solution.json'.

## Instructions to Perform the Task
1. When your workspace loads in **VS Code**, use the **Explorer** panel on the left to locate your files.
2. Open and inspect `jvm_heap_dump.txt` inside `student_workspace/`.
3. Open `solution.json` in `student_workspace/` and perform the required modifications.
4. Save your changes (`Ctrl + S` or `Cmd + S`).
5. Open the built-in terminal by clicking **Terminal > New Terminal** from the top menu.
6. Verify your progress by running `python run.py` locally in the terminal.

## Validation
Once you have saved your files and verified your progress, return to the platform dashboard and click the **"Run Test" / "Verify"** button. This will automatically evaluate your changes and generate your score!

## Grading Criteria
| Test Case | Requirement | Marks |
| --------- | ----------- | ----- |
| **TC1** | solution.json exists | 3 Marks |
| **TC2** | Memory leak class suspect correctly identified | 3 Marks |
| **TC3** | Correct list/collection object causing leak identified | 3 Marks |
| **TC4** | Line number of insertion leak mapped correctly | 3 Marks |
| **TC5** | RCA analysis notes populated | 2 Marks |
| **TC6** | Recommended heap memory increase parameter included | 2 Marks |
| **TC7** | Thread dump correlation correct | 2 Marks |
| **TC8** | JVM arguments settings validated | 2 Marks |

**Total Score: 20 Marks**

## Important Notes
- This is an auto-evaluated question. Ensure all code edits are properly saved and the 'run.py' checks pass before submission.
