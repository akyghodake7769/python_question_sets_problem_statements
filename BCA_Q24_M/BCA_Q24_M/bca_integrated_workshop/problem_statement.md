# Basic Code Analysis: Integrated Outage Troubleshooting Workshop

Duration : 90 Min.

## Scenario
A major production crash occurred in the checkout cluster. Correlate Apache logs, Java Spring exceptions, database deadlocks, and configuration properties. Identify the root cause and draft a developer-ready post-mortem.

## Task Objectives
Perform the following actions inside the `student_workspace` directory:
- Fill out 'post_mortem_report.json' in your workspace.

## Instructions to Perform the Task
1. When your workspace loads in **VS Code**, use the **Explorer** panel on the left to locate your files.
2. Navigate to and click the specific files mentioned in the Task Objectives.
3. Make the necessary code edits in the editor.
4. Press `Ctrl + S` (Windows) or `Cmd + S` (Mac) to save your changes.
5. If you need to run commands, open the built-in terminal by clicking **Terminal > New Terminal** from the top menu.
6. Verify your progress by running `python run.py` locally in the terminal.

## Validation
Once you have saved your files and verified your progress, return to the platform dashboard and click the **"Run Test" / "Verify"** button. This will automatically evaluate your changes and generate your score!

## Grading Criteria
Your performance will be evaluated based on the following test cases:

| Test Case | Requirement | Marks |
| --------- | ----------- | ----- |
| **TC1** | post_mortem_report.json exists and is valid JSON | 3 Marks |
| **TC2** | Root cause correctly identified as database connection pool exhaustion | 3 Marks |
| **TC3** | Mismatched environment property config parameter mapped correctly | 3 Marks |
| **TC4** | File name, class, and method of leak suspect correct | 3 Marks |
| **TC5** | Outage timeline (start/end) correctly parsed from log lines | 2 Marks |
| **TC6** | Business impact metrics correctly logged | 2 Marks |
| **TC7** | Immediate recovery steps documented | 2 Marks |
| **TC8** | Long-term architectural remediations included | 2 Marks |

**Total Score: 20 Marks**

## Important Notes
- This is an auto-evaluated question. Ensure all code edits are properly saved and the 'run.py' checks pass before submission.
