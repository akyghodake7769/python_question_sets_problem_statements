****Low-Level Design (LLD) – Patient Health Monitor
(Python Core & Pandas DataFrames)****

****Difficulty Level****: Medium | Total Marks: 20
****Duration** : 30 Minutes
**Design Format**: 1 Class | 7 Methods | 7 Test Cases**

**Summary of Design Requirements**
Implement a class `b` to track and analyze patient heart rates using Pandas.
The class focuses on data cleaning, identify peak health readings, and calculating medical trends.
The class should:

- Load patient health logs from a CSV file.
- Handle missing heart rate values by cleaning the dataset.
- Provide statistical insights such as averages and extreme values.
- Monitor risk levels by identifying and counting high-risk patients.

**Concepts Tested**

- DataFrame state management and schemas
- Data cleaning (NaN handling)
- Aggregation and Grouping (`max`, `groupby`, `mean`)
- Boolean indexing and filtering
- Unique value extraction and counting

**Problem Statement**
Design a health monitoring tool `HealthMonitor` to analyze heart rate data. The system starts by loading `health.csv` containing patient vitals. The monitor must be capable of cleaning incomplete records, identifying peak readings, and generating reports on patient averages and risk categories.

***Note: The foundational methods for initialization and data loading (Method 1 & 2) are pre-provided.***

**Operations (Methods)**

1. **Initialize Monitor**
   def __init__(self):

- Logic: Initialize `self.df = None`.

2. **Read Heart Data**
   def read_data(self, file_path: str):

- Logic: Load the CSV file into the Pandas DataFrame `self.df`.

3. **Clean Records [4 Marks]**
   def clean_records(self) -> int:

- Logic: Drop rows where `HeartRate` is NaN. Update the internal DataFrame.
- Return: The number of rows removed.

4. **Find Highest Rate [4 Marks]**
   def find_highest_rate(self) -> int:

- Logic: Find the maximum heart rate value across all cleaned records.
- Return: The peak integer heart rate.

5. **Average Heart Rate per Patient [4 Marks]**
   def patient_averages(self) -> dict:

- Logic: Calculate mean `HeartRate` for each `PatientID` (rounded to 2 decimal places).
- Return: Dictionary with `PatientID` as keys and average heart rates as values.

6. **High Risk Patients [4 Marks]**
   def high_risk(self, threshold: int) -> list:

- Logic: Identify unique `PatientID` values who have at least one reading above `threshold`.
- Return: Sorted list of unique high-risk Patient IDs.

7. **Count High Risk [4 Marks]**
   def count_high_risk(self, threshold: int) -> int:

- Logic: Count how many unique patients meet the high-risk criteria (> `threshold`).
- Return: Integer count of high-risk patients.

**Visible Test Case Descriptions**

- TC1: `self.df` is `None` upon class creation.
- TC2: `read_data()` loads the sample data into `self.df` (12 rows initially).
- TC3: `clean_records()` returns `2` (Removing records for P02 and P06).
- TC4: `find_highest_rate()` returns `110`.
- TC5: `patient_averages()['P01']` returns approximately `72.33`.
- TC6: `high_risk(100)` returns `['P03']`.
- TC7: `count_high_risk(100)` returns `1`.
