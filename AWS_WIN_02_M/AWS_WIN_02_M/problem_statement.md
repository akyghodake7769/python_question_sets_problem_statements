# AWS EC2 (Windows Server) Monitoring, Logging & Service Management

**Difficulty Level:** Medium

**Duration:** 60 Minutes

## Scenario

As a Windows Cloud Ops Engineer, you are responsible for maintaining server availability, configuring automated administrative scripts, monitoring CPU/memory/disk performance, validating network connectivity, and diagnosing server health issues. You need to provision a new Windows Server instance, host a web service using IIS, schedule a memory monitoring task, generate disk and CPU process utilization reports, test local network connectivity, and audit critical system event errors.

## Task Objectives

Perform the following actions in the AWS cloud and guest OS environment:

### 1. Provision EC2 Instance (Windows Server)

- **Instance Name:** `labskraft-windows-monitor-<your-labskraft-username>` (replace `<your-labskraft-username>` with your actual username, e.g. `labs-kraft-demo106`)
- **AMI (Operating System):** Microsoft Windows Server 2022 Base (or newer)
- **Instance Type:** `t2.micro`
- **Region:** `eu-west-2` (Europe - London)

### 2. Install and Manage Web Services (IIS)

Install the **Web-Server (IIS)** role on the running Windows Server instance.
- Ensure that the World Wide Web Publishing Service (`W3SVC`) is enabled (configured to start automatically) and is in a `Running` state.

### 3. Configure Scheduled Memory Monitoring

Create a Windows Scheduled Task named `MemoryMonitorTask`.
- The task must run every **5 minutes** under the Local System or Administrator account.
- It must execute a command or PowerShell script that appends the current system date and free memory statistics to the log file `C:\workspace\monitor\mem_usage.log` (create the directory `C:\workspace\monitor` if it does not exist).

### 4. System Monitoring, Network Validation & Diagnostics

Ensure all reports and diagnostics logs are placed in `C:\workspace\monitor\`:
- **Disk Auditing:** Analyze disk space for the primary `C:` drive and write the disk utilization report (e.g., using `Get-PSDrive C` or `Get-Volume`) to `C:\workspace\monitor\disk_report.txt`.
- **CPU & Process Monitoring:** Identify processes consuming the most CPU by writing a report listing the top 5 CPU-consuming processes (e.g., using `Get-Process | Sort-Object CPU -Descending | Select-Object -First 5`) to `C:\workspace\monitor\cpu_process_report.txt`.
- **Network Validation:** Validate connectivity on the local web server port (port 80) by performing a TCP connection test (e.g. using `Test-NetConnection -Port 80`) and saving the results to `C:\workspace\monitor\network_status.txt`.
- **Event Log Diagnostics:** Query the Windows **System Event Log** for recent events of type `Error`. Extract the description/messages of the latest 5 error entries and write them to the file `C:\workspace\monitor\event_errors.txt`.

## Verification

Once you have performed the tasks, you can run the verification script. The verification script will check the configuration of your EC2 resources via the AWS client and connect via Systems Manager (SSM) inside the Windows Guest OS to check IIS service status, scheduled tasks, CPU/disk reports, network connection status, and event log files.

## Grading Criteria

Your performance will be evaluated based on the following test cases:

| Test Case | Requirement | Validation | Marks |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- |
| **TC1**   | **EC2 Instance Provisioning** | Running `t2.micro` Windows Server instance named `labskraft-windows-monitor-<username>` in `eu-west-2` region. | 5 Marks |
| **TC2**   | **Service Management (IIS)** | Web-Server (IIS) role is installed, and the `W3SVC` service is enabled and Running. | 5 Marks |
| **TC3**   | **Automated Monitoring (Scheduled Task)** | Scheduled Task `MemoryMonitorTask` exists and is configured to log memory info to `mem_usage.log`. | 5 Marks |
| **TC4**   | **Disk, CPU, Network & Log Diagnostics** | `disk_report.txt`, `cpu_process_report.txt`, `network_status.txt`, and `event_errors.txt` exist in `C:\workspace\monitor` with correct info. | 5 Marks |

**Total Score: 20 Marks**

## Important Notes

- Ensure the instance name matches exactly: `labskraft-windows-monitor-<your-labskraft-username>`.
- The scheduled task name must be exactly `MemoryMonitorTask`.
- Ensure all diagnostics files are written to the correct folder: `C:\workspace\monitor`.
