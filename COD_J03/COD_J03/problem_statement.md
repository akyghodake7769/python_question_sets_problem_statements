# Java: Digital Banking System

Implement a Java program using inheritance and interfaces to manage different types of bank accounts. The program should:
*   Calculate interest based on the specific account type
*   Enforce withdrawal limits and minimum balance requirements
*   Track the total number of active accounts using static members

**Class Description**
Complete the classes `SavingsAccount` and `CurrentAccount` which extend the abstract class `BankAccount`. You must also implement the `AccountOperations` interface.

1.  **BankAccount (Abstract Class)**:
    *   `double balance`: Stores the current balance.
    *   `String accountNumber`: Stores the account ID.
    *   `abstract void deposit(double amount)`: Adds money to the balance.
    *   `abstract boolean withdraw(double amount)`: Removes money if constraints are met.

2.  **SavingsAccount**:
    *   Minimum Balance: $500.
    *   Withdrawal must keep the balance $\ge 500$.
    *   Interest Rate: 4% per year.

3.  **CurrentAccount**:
    *   Overdraft Limit: $2000$ (balance can go down to $-2000$).
    *   Interest Rate: 0%.

**Returns**
*   `double`: The updated balance after operations.
*   `boolean`: `true` if the withdrawal was successful, `false` otherwise.

**Constraints**
*   $1 \le NumberOfAccounts \le 50$.
*   $0 \le InitialBalance \le 1,000,000$.

**Input Format For Custom Testing**
The first line contains an integer $N$ denoting the number of operations.
Each operation consists of: `{AccountType} {AccountNumber} {InitialBalance} {OperationType} {Amount}`.

**Sample Case 0**
**Sample Input For Custom Testing**
```text
2
Savings ACC01 1000 Withdraw 600
Current ACC02 100 Withdraw 1500
```

**Sample Output**
```text
Withdrawal Failed: Minimum balance requirement not met.
Withdrawal Successful: New Balance: -1400.0
```

**Explanation**
Case 1: Withdrawing 600 from 1000 leaves 400, which is below the 500 minimum for Savings.
Case 2: Current accounts allow overdrafts up to 2000, so a 1500 withdrawal from 100 is valid.
