# .NET Lab: Dependency Injection captive lifetime validation

Duration : 35 Min.

## Scenario
A performance analysis identifies memory leaks due to Scoped services registered inside Singleton services (captive dependency).

## Task Objectives
Perform the following actions inside the `student_workspace` directory:
- Refactor DI registrations in Program.cs to resolve captive lifetimes.

## Instructions to Perform the Task
1. When your workspace loads in **VS Code**, use the **Explorer** panel on the left to locate your files.
2. Navigate to and click the specific files mentioned in the Task Objectives.
3. Make the necessary code edits in the editor.
4. Press `Ctrl + S` (Windows) or `Cmd + S` (Mac) to save your changes.
5. If you need to run commands, open the built-in terminal by clicking **Terminal > New Terminal** from the top menu.

## Validation
Once you have saved your files and are ready to submit, return to the platform dashboard and click the **"Run Test" / "Verify"** button. This will automatically evaluate your changes and generate your score!

## Grading Criteria
Your performance will be evaluated based on the following test cases:

| Test Case | Requirement | Marks |
| --------- | ----------- | ----- |
| **TC1** | Local VM Environment active and verified | 0 Marks |
| **TC2** | Program.cs exists in workspace | 5 Marks |
| **TC3** | Transient / Scoped services are not injected into Singleton class constructors | 5 Marks |
| **TC4** | Register target scopes correctly under builder.Services | 5 Marks |
| **TC5** | No syntax or compilation issues in Program.cs | 5 Marks |

**Total Score: 20 Marks**
