# DB_Q05_E: Workspace Navigation & Setup

## Scenario
The candidate must configure the following data operations setup in their workspace environment.

## Username & Naming Conventions
- Candidates must use their normalized username (`<username>`) and exam code (`<exam_code>`) for any resource creation.
- Default resources should follow prefix patterns like `<username>-<exam_code>`.

## Task Objectives
1. **Setup requirements**: Create a directory under Shared space and set up a basic metadata log.
2. Ensure the resources pass standard structural and metadata checks.

## Verification
- Local run test script `run.py` can be executed to verify local workspace properties.
- Central validation runs queries against the live workspace to verify integration.

## Grading Criteria
- **TC1: Directory existence (/Shared/day1-workspace)** (4 Marks)
- **TC2: Metadata file presence (metadata.json)** (4 Marks)
- **TC3: Metadata structure validation** (4 Marks)
- **TC4: Reserved validation** (4 Marks)
- **TC5: Reserved validation** (4 Marks)
