# DevOps Lab: Automated Jenkins Master-Slave Java WAR Deployment to Tomcat

**Difficulty Level:** Medium
**Duration:** 120 Minutes

## Scenario

Your company runs a legacy Java enterprise web application packaged as a Web Application Archive (`.war`) file. To protect the Jenkins control plane from high resource usage during compilation and to secure direct server deployments, you are tasked with designing and implementing a distributed Jenkins Master-Slave architecture.

The Jenkins Master will serve as the orchestration controller, listening for automatic **GitHub webhook triggers** on updates to the `master` branch. The actual compilation, packaging (using **Maven**), and deployment (using **Apache Tomcat**) will take place on a dedicated Jenkins Slave node. Communication between the Master and Slave must be secured using SSH keys. Once the Maven build completes, the pipeline must deploy the `.war` package to a Tomcat instance running on the Slave, verify the deployment, and generate an audit report.

---

## Task Objectives

To complete the setup of this distributed architecture, you must perform the following actions:
1. **Configure Master-Slave SSH Connection:** Set up passwordless key-based SSH access between the Jenkins Master and Slave.
2. **Register the Jenkins Slave Node:** Add the Slave as a permanent agent in the Jenkins dashboard via the SSH launcher.
3. **Configure GitHub Webhook:** Integrate a webhook from GitHub to automatically trigger builds on Master branch push events.
4. **Build the Java Web App:** Create a pipeline or build job restricted to run exclusively on the Slave node that compiles and packages the app using Maven (`mvn clean package`).
5. **Deploy to Apache Tomcat:** Copy the packaged `.war` file to the local Tomcat `webapps` directory on the Slave and verify it is running.
6. **Generate Evaluation Logs:** Write the pipeline outcomes to a structured audit report file.

## Requirements

> [!WARNING]
> **CRITICAL RESOURCE CONFIGURATION & NAMING REQUIREMENT:**
> 1. You must name all resources using your **AWS IAM username** as a **prefix** (e.g., if your AWS IAM username is `ltm-devops-user1`, then your VM must be named `ltm-devops-user1-jenkins-master` and your slave `ltm-devops-user1-jenkins-slave`). Do **NOT** use your platform username (e.g. `LabsKraft`) or the default OS user `labskraft` as the name or suffix.
> 2. You **MUST** attach the IAM role **`Ec2_instance_SSM`** to **both** EC2 instances. This is required for the automated grading tool to verify your local Jenkins configurations and files via AWS Systems Manager (SSM). Without this role attached, test verification checks will fail.
> 3. You **MUST** use **`t3.micro`** as the instance type for all VMs.

### 1. VM Infrastructure & Ports
- **Jenkins Master Node (`<username>-jenkins-master`):**
  - Runs Jenkins Master.
  - Inbound ports allowed: Port `22` (SSH) from your IP, Port `8080` (HTTP) from Anywhere.
- **Jenkins Slave Node (`<username>-jenkins-slave`):**
  - Runs Apache Tomcat 9/10, Java JDK/JRE, and Maven.
  - Inbound ports allowed: Port `22` (SSH) from the Master's private IP, Port `8080` (Tomcat HTTP) from Anywhere.
  - Remote root directory: `/home/ubuntu/jenkins-slave`.

### 2. Connectivity & Credentials
- Set up an SSH key pair on the Master. Add the public key to the `/home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the Slave node.
- Configure a new credentials item in Jenkins of type **"SSH Username with private key"** (using username `ubuntu` and the private key generated on Master).
- Register the Slave in Jenkins Nodes under the name `<username>-jenkins-slave`, applying the label `<username>-java-builder`.

### 3. Pipeline Build & Deployment Steps
- Create a Freestyle or Pipeline project in Jenkins named `<username>-Tomcat-Deployment-Eval`.
- Configure the job to run exclusively on node label `<username>-java-builder`.
- Trigger the job automatically using **GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling**.
- In the build steps:
  - Clone the repository.
  - Run the Maven packaging command: `mvn clean package`.
  - Deploy the resulting WAR file by copying it to the local Tomcat webapps directory:
    ```bash
    cp target/*.war /var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/app.war
    ```
  - Generate an evaluation audit log at `/home/ubuntu/build-logs/tomcat-deploy.log` on the Slave containing the build status.

## Sample Evaluation Report

Your pipeline should write an audit log to `/home/ubuntu/build-logs/tomcat-deploy.log` on the Slave matching this format:

```text
GIT_CLONE=SUCCESS
MAVEN_BUILD=SUCCESS
TOMCAT_DEPLOYMENT=SUCCESS
PIPELINE_NAME=<your-aws-iam-username>-Tomcat-Deployment-Eval
BUILD_NUMBER=15
FINAL_STATUS=SUCCESS
TIMESTAMP=Fri Jun 19 04:30:00 UTC 2026
```

## Deliverables

The final implementation must consist of:

| Deliverable | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Jenkins Master Setup** | Active Master EC2 instance serving Jenkins on HTTP port 8080. |
| **Active SSH Agent Node** | Connected permanent node `<your-aws-iam-username>-jenkins-slave` showing as "Online" in Jenkins. |
| **Tomcat Web Server** | Active Tomcat service listening on port 8080 on the Slave. |
| **GitHub Webhook Integration** | Configured repository webhook that automatically triggers Jenkins on push events. |
| **Maven Deployment Job** | Project named `<your-aws-iam-username>-Tomcat-Deployment-Eval` restricted to label `<your-aws-iam-username>-java-builder`. |
| **Evaluation Audit Report** | A structured status log at `/home/ubuntu/build-logs/tomcat-deploy.log` on the Slave. |

---

## Technology Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Amazon EC2** | Compute infrastructure for Master and Slave hosts. |
| **Ubuntu Linux** | Server operating systems. |
| **Jenkins** | CI/CD Server orchestrating builds. |
| **Maven** | Build tool used to compile code and generate `.war` packages. |
| **Apache Tomcat** | Web Application Server hosting the packaged Java web app. |
| **SSH** | Secure channel for Agent connectivity and artifact deployment. |

## Verification & Grading Criteria

> [!IMPORTANT]
> VM Creation and Naming validation is strictly enforced. The VM names must exactly match the convention `<username>-jenkins-master` and `<username>-jenkins-slave`. Creating a VM with an incorrect name or using a suffix/portal username will result in immediate failure of the VM Validation test case, even if the VM is successfully created.

Your configuration will be automatically graded based on the following verification checks:

| Test Case | Requirement | Validation Method | Marks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TC1** | **VM Creation and Naming Validation** | Verifies that all required VMs are created and their names exactly match the expected convention (`<username>-jenkins-master` and `<username>-jenkins-slave`). | 2 Marks |
| **TC2** | **Jenkins Master-Slave Connection** | Verifies that node `<username>-jenkins-slave` is configured in Jenkins, connected via SSH, and is online. | 3 Marks |
| **TC3** | **GitHub Webhook Trigger** | Verifies that a GitHub webhook is active and auto-triggers the Jenkins job on code commits. | 3 Marks |
| **TC4** | **Maven Build Execution** | Verifies that the Java code compiles successfully on the Slave and outputs the target `.war` package (restricted to `<username>-java-builder`). | 4 Marks |
| **TC5** | **Tomcat Deploy Validation** | Verifies that the `.war` application is successfully deployed to Tomcat's webapps directory on the Slave. | 4 Marks |
| **TC6** | **Pipeline Log & Report Generation** | Verifies that the log file exists at `/home/ubuntu/build-logs/tomcat-deploy.log` on the Slave with success properties. | 4 Marks |

**Total Score: 20 Marks**

## Optional Enhancements

For advanced practice, you can attempt to implement:
- Setup a Jenkinsfile pipeline script checked into GitHub.
- Automate Tomcat deployment using Tomcat Manager REST API instead of local copying.
- Secure HTTP web traffic using self-signed SSL/TLS certificates on Tomcat.
- Containerize the Tomcat deployment using Docker containers on the Slave.

---

## Real-World Use Case

This Master-Slave configuration replicates enterprise-grade CI/CD architecture where compilation, unit testing, and deployments are segregated to separate agent nodes. This keeps the central orchestrator responsive, allows scale out of build infrastructure dynamically based on job queues, and isolates deployment permissions to secure network boundaries.
